    bio: "David is the sort of person who brings bread to a meeting and somehow leaves with three new friends and a database schema. He learned sourdough to fix his patience, then discovered it also fixes people’s moods. When he’s not troubleshooting flaky tests, he’s cataloging his growing thimble collection with a very serious tagging system. His superpower is breaking big problems into tiny, boring steps until they surrender. Favorite sound: the quiet click of a green build. Least favorite: the kettle when it’s empty.",

    bio: "Priya approaches life like a careful refactor: change one thing, run the tests, celebrate with tea. She mentors newcomers by drawing diagrams on whatever surface is closest, including napkins and occasionally her own sleeve. She believes in humane standups, crisp commit messages, and feature flags as a love language. On weekends she experiments with chai blends and monitors CI pipelines for fun. If a meeting needs rescuing, she’ll turn requirements into bullet points before anyone notices. Her desk plant has three names and an alarming growth rate.",

    bio: "Mateo automates chores out of pure principle. If he does anything twice, a script appears. He keeps a tidy spreadsheet for everything, including impulse buys and failed bread recipes. His playlists go from ambient focus to Latin dance without warning, miraculously improving sprint velocity. Teammates trust him to spot edge cases hiding in plain sight. He documents as he goes, then writes a friendlier version for future humans. Secret hobby: photographing interesting shadows on brutalist buildings and labeling them like API endpoints.",

When design and engineering argue, she translates into both languages and sneaks in acceptance criteria while everyone nods. She schedules deep work like it’s a medical appointment and fiercely protects it. Outside work, she curates miniature museums inside shoeboxes, each with a story and a QR code. She collects small victories and celebrates them loudly.",

When confronted with weirdness, he reaches for logs, not vibes. He teaches git like a storytelling tool and swears by meaningful branch names. Lunch breaks involve slow walks, podcasts about cities, and a stubborn refusal to eat at his desk. He’s the teammate who quietly fixes the build before anyone else finishes complaining in Slack.",
